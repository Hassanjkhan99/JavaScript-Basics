// In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store a single type of data

let x = 10
let y = "a,b"
let z = true
let c = undefined
let d = null
