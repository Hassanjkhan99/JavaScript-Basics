// JavaScript includes operators same as other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.

//assignment operator ==> =
let x = 5 // assigns number 5 to 'x'
let y = 2
let z = x + y

// Arithmetic Operators
// +	Adds two numeric operands.
// -	Subtract right operand from left operand
// *	Multiply two numeric operands.
// /	Divide left operand by right operand.
// %	Modulus operator. Returns remainder of two operands.
// ++	Increment operator. Increase operand value by one.
// --	Decrement operator. Decrease value by one.

var a = 5, b = 10;

var c = a + b; //shows addition and returns 15
z = b - a; //shows subtraction and returns 5
z = a * b; //shows multiplication and returns 50
z = b / a; //shows division and returns 2
z = a % 2; //shows division remainder 1
